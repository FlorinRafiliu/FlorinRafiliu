## Hello there,

I am currently a second-year Computer Science student at *Babe»ô-Bolyai* University in Cluj-Napoca. During my studies, I have worked on several personal projects, into which I have invested effort and dedication, and satisfied with the progress I have made.

If someone were to ask me, "How would you describe yourself in a few words?" I would say that I have a strong passion for learning and always strive to understand concepts deeply by asking *why?*.
